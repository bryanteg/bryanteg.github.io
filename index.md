## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1, part 1 This lab was intreasting because I was able to learn how to make a github account for the first time. I was also able to get a partner who seemed to know more than I do which was really helpful. I also learned how to use the linux comand prompt which was a new process to me.

Lab 2, part 2 This lab was also my favorite because it involved madlibs which is a fun game that involved meshing words that could correlate. It was also tricky because the coding was a lot different compared to other languages that im used to and I mixed them up. Overall this lab was enjoyable because it was easy and fun.

Lab 6, part 1 This lab was pretty challenging becuase it invoved vectors which I previously knew them as list. I enjoyed this lab because I had 2 partners instead of 1 which made it easier for all of us. I learned about how it stored them into the vector and that you had to skip the first value in the vector because it wasnt needed.
