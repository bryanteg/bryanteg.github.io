## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1, part 1

This lab was interesting because I was able to learn how to make a github account for the first time. I was also able to get a partner who seemed to know more than I do which was really helpful. I also learned how     to use the linux command prompt which was a new process to me.

* Lab 2, part 2

This lab was also my favorite because it involved mad libs which is a fun game that involved meshing words that could correlate. It was also tricky because the coding was a lot different compared to other languages    that I'm used to and I mixed them up. Overall this lab was enjoyable because it was easy and fun.

* Lab 6, part 1

This lab was pretty challenging because it involved vectors which I previously knew as a list. I enjoyed this lab because I had 2 partners instead of 1 which made it easier for all of us. I learned about how it        stored them into the vector and that you had to skip the first value in the vector because it wasn't needed.
